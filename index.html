            <p> I'm exploring a career switch into tech, such as Front-End or Full Stack Web Development looking for roles that offer both high demand and the flexibility of remote work. I also have an interest in digital creativity, like graphic design and possibly marketing, which could pair really well with a coding career.</p>
